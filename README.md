mÂ²pong - Multi Mobile Pong
===

A small pong game I hacked for a party. The players control their paddles with their smartphones via wifi using full screen touch controls. The mobile client runs fully in a modern browser like Firefox or Chrome, no extra app needed.

Status
---
The game lacks the "multi" part of it's name at the moment. Only two players are supported. So it's just a classic pong with a mobile component.

This project was a quick hack for a party and I didn't have the time to complete all the features I had planed. Maybe I will add these in the future. But probably not ;)
